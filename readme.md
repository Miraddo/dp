# UserDataProcessor

UserDataProcessor is a server application designed to handle and process user-generated data. It validates incoming JSON payloads, applies user-specific quotas, and stores or forwards data as needed.

## Features

- **Data Receipt**: Accept user data through HTTP POST requests.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity through JSON schema validation.
- **Quota Management**: Enforce data upload limits to prevent system overuse.
